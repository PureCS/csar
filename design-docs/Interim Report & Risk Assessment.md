<!-- TODO before converting to PDF, make sure this is on its own page -->

TODO write: chapter structure, chapters: bg materials, references, reqs, design so far

# Work Plan
The work completed so far can be seen in full in the Github [commits](https://github.research.its.qmul.ac.uk/ec15116/csar/commits/master).  
A concise description is that: the command-line interface, csar query language parsing, Java code parsing, and search (partially) are completed.

* 08/01/2018 - Implement searching method usages
* 11/01/2018 - Finish searching (supporting from and contains query clauses)
* 12/02/2018 - Implement refactoring

# Risk Assessment
| Description of risk | Description of impact | Likelihood rating | Impact rating | Preventative actions |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Low motivation/Burn out | Overdue/incomplete work | Medium | High | Schedule project work carefully, leave time for entertainment. |
| Busy schedule/Poor time management | Overdue/incomplete work | Medium | High | Schedule carefully, try to get work done on time as necessary. |
| Advisor has busy schedule | Inadequate work quality. | Medium | Low | Take initiative as necessary, use library resources to fill in gaps in knowledge. |
| Code defects | Inadequate program functionality. | Medium | Medium | Try to fix them, if not possible then write about them in the report and leave them. |
| Code bugs | Inadequate program quality. | Medium | Low | Try to fix them, if not possible then write about them in the report and leave them. Do not pretend they do not exist. |
| Code quality | More difficult development. | Low | Low | Incremental development should help prevent this. |
