% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
  Software developers frequently search code.
  Semantics-based code searching is a context sensitive variant of code searching.
  There is currently a lack of semantics-based code search tools and furthermore no semantics-based, integrated code search and refactor tool.
  This paper will detail the creation of the csar (code search and refactor) tool, which aims to be versatile, query-driven, semantics-based and language-agnostic.
  It will cover the pre-requisite knowledge to understand this paper, requirements (general, selected and backlogged), design (with a running example), implementation and background material.

% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{What is csar?}

csar aims to be a unified framework for code searching and refactoring. It will take as input descriptions of searches and corresponding refactors in a newly devised query language called the csar query language. This results in a versatile and descriptive framework, which can target any programming language without the developer needing to know the specifics.

Furthermore, csar aims to be flexible code-wise. Most of its API will be publicly exposed and documented. Third-party developers will be able to use this to embed csar into complicated build processes and other applications.

\subsection{Pre-requisite Knowledge}
``Refactoring is the process of changing the structure of software without changing its behavior.". \autocite{murphy2012we} The aim of this is to improve the maintainability and readability of the code.

``Semantics-based search seeks to improve search accuracy by understanding the searcher's intent and the contextual meaning of terms as they appear in the searchable dataspace, whether on the Web or within a closed system, to generate more relevant results." \autocite{wikipediasemanticsearch} Henceforth, this is what is meant by `code search' or `search'.

Searching is important because it increases developer productivity by enabling reuse, and it is important because it accounts for a significant portion of a developer's activity. \autocite{reiss2009semantics,stolee2014solving}

There have been attempts to solve searching which have failed, the reasons for this includes: trying to do too much or too little, requiring too much user input, and yielding irrelevant search results. \autocite{reiss2009semantics,stolee2014solving}

Refactoring increases developer productivity by attempting to automate common tasks, and it is important because it accounts for a significant portion of a developer's activity. \autocite{mens2004survey,murphy2012we}

There have been attempts to solve refactoring which have failed, the reasons for this includes: the degree of automation, reliability, configurability and openness, coverage, scalability, and language independence. \autocite{mens2004survey} Furthermore, we can conclude that existing tools have failed because they are underused. \autocite{murphy2012we}

Searching and refactoring are both hard to implement because optimally they should be language-agnostic\autocite{mens2004survey,reiss2009semantics}, which results in a trade-off between expressiveness and how language-agnostic you want the implementation to be.

``Parsing, syntax analysis or syntactic analysis is the process of analysing a string of symbols, either in natural language or in computer languages, conforming to the rules of a formal grammar." \autocite{wikipediaparsing}

``The visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates." \autocite{wikipediavisitorpattern}

ANTLR is a parser-generator, which in conjunction with appropriate grammars, will recognize and parse languages.

```A compiler-compiler (also known as a parser-generator) is a programming tool that creates a parser, interpreter, or compiler from some form of formal description of a language and machine. The input may be a text file containing the grammar written in BNF or EBNF that defines the syntax of a programming language, and whose generated output is some source code of the parser for the programming language, although other definitions exist." \autocite{wikipediacompilercompiler}

% Requirements
\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Primary Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A user guide detailing how to use the tool and its query language.
  \item A custom query language to describe the operations to carry out.
  \item Parsing of source code.
  \item Language-agnostic searching.
  \item Custom search domains.
  \item Language-agnostic refactoring.
  \item Flexible program output.
  \item High efficiency.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Secondary Requirements}
These requirements are non-essential, but may be addressed if there is sufficient time, or if priorities shift.
The implementation details of each will be outlined.

\subsubsection{Indexing parsed project source code}
We want to index previously parsed project code and use this to speed up further interactions with the same project code.
We also want to maintain an updated index of the code.

We have two storage approaches we can take:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Storage Approach: Flat Files\newline
  Either map the files to a parallel hierarchy in `.csar` which contains their parsed outputs, or, store them all in the same folder where their file names are the hashes of the input files.
  The second approach may cause problems if hash collisions occur, so care must be taken when choosing the hashing algorithm to be used.
  The last modified dates of the source code and their parsed code can be used to determine which files require updating.
  \item Storage Approach: Database (i.e. SQLite)\newline
  Store a `(Path, LastModified, ParsedCode)` relation in the database, preferably in a `.csar` directory.
  Note: `LastModified` is a date, which is the last time that file was modified, as of when it was parsed.
  We can use this to determine which files need updating.
\end{enumerate}

It is important to note that using the last modified dates of files can be error-prone, since they can be spoofed, but it would offer no advantage to an attacker.

\subsubsection{Supporting Mercurial (hg)/Subversion (svn) repositories}
This would be done analogously to the git implementation, but the program arguments we use when invoking their binaries will be different.
Some possibilities are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hg: 'hg status --all`
  \item Svn: `svn list -R' or `svn status'
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Support for further searching}
The process for this is described earlier, I would simply have to repeat the process for each additional element I want to support searching for.

\subsubsection{IntelliJ IDEA Integration}
csar can be integrated into this IDE in one of two ways:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Internally - csar can be implemented as an alternative to IDEA's structural search,
  this would enable it to carry out the following tasks:
  identifier usage finding, overridden method finding, type hierarchy resolving, refactoring, and semantics-based searching.
  This requires placing our code in \href{https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/tree/master/platform/structuralsearch/source/com/intellij/structuralsearch}{platform/structuralsearch/...} and creating adapters to enable our code to provide the same interface as the current IDEA ones, to ensure maximum compatibility.
  \item As a Plugin - csar can be implemented as a third-party plugin which introduces a new query field.
  This field would allow users to type csar queries and then execute them, displaying the results in a standard IDEA result window.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Documentation - csar will be accompanied by four pieces of documentation: the report (design and implementation details), javadocs (component level details), readme (how to run csar), and the user guide (how to use csar).
  \item Efficiency - the implementation will maximize the usage of algorithms which run in polynomial time.
  It will also be benchmarked against a large input, to highlight deficiencies.
  \item Extensibility - csar will be open source, will be language-agnostic so that users can easily implement support for their language of choice, will expose a public API with great usage of interfaces, and will thoroughly utilize dependency injection to allow third-party developers to customize its behaviour.
  \item Interoperability - csar will have a user guide explaining how to invoke it from other applications and will support flexible output formats.
  \item Open source
  \item Portable - csar will be written in Java (version 8) which is a cross-platform framework.
  Java 8 runs on platforms including recent versions of Windows, Mac OS X, and various Linux distributions. \autocite{javasysreqs}
  \item Quality/Reliability - csar will be well designed and make appropriate use of configuration management and unit testing to detect bugs early in the software development life cycle.
  csar will also make use of well-tested and maintained libraries and platforms where possible (within reason).
  If necessary, contributions to third-party libraries will also be made to ensure high quality dependencies.
  \item Scalability - csar will be multi-threaded, hence in general the more cores a user has available the faster it will be.
  Caching will also be used where appropriate so that larger input projects run in reasonable time.
  \item Testability - csar will be designed to make testing easy (e.g. heavy use of dependency injection).
  Test-Driven Development will also be used where appropriate, to ensure each component of csar works as intended.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope}
This project has strict deadlines, so not every feature will be fully implemented.
The selected requirements (scope) of this project will be detailed in this section.

The query language will have two versions: 1.x.x (implemented) and $ \geq $ 2.x.x (potential improvements).
The implemented version will formally define the scope of the query language in the implementation, and the potential improvements version will define a more exhaustive schema.
My goal is not to develop an exhaustive query language which can express any language element in any language since it would take very long (it would constitute an entire project itself), hence $ \geq $ 2.x.x will be more exhaustive than 1.x.x but not the ultimate query language.

Parsing of java source code (Java 8) will be supported.
csar will be designed such that other programming languages can easily be integrated into it in the future.
They will just need to write a parser written for them, analogously to how the java parser will be written.

Searching will be implemented to only work on methods (finding their definitions and usages) for now.
To implement it for the other language elements described in the query language would be as simple as copy-pasting the code for method searching and changing the types and getters involved.
However, this would be a greatly time consuming and tedious task.
It is also possible that further complications may arise which may need to be addressed in the form of post-processors for the programming languages, this is especially true for dynamic programming languages.

It will also support narrowing the search domain by a `.gitignore' file for directories which are git repositories, and by custom `.csarignore' file. Support for other version control systems are a backlog task and may not be fulfilled, but will follow trivially from the git implementation.
The git implementation will require calling the git binary with a specific argument and reading the output, which will reveal which files it is currently tracking.

Refactoring is very complicated and time consuming, so we will only consider two operations.
The first is changing method parameters, this involves resolving all usages of the method in question (in various contexts), modifying the method calls and its definition and ensuring no naming collisions occur.
The second is renaming methods, this should follow from changing method parameters, since if we resolve all method usages we should be able to simply rename them all and ensure no naming collisions occur.

The program output could technically support thousands of formats, but for simplicity it will only support two: plain text and JSON.
If alternatives are required, a third-party developer will be able to easily add their own result formatter.

Efficiency will mainly be addressed by introducing multi-threading and caching where possible.
Specific algorithms to be used are currently unknown, but may become available as the details of the implementation are gradually addressed.

% Design
\section{Design}
\subsection{High-level Structure}

\begin{figure}[!hb]
  \centering
  \caption{High-level Structure}
  \includegraphics{figure-1}
\end{figure}

A command-line interface `csar-frontend' for csar is provided called `csar-cli' (you can write your own).

The `csar-api' defines the csar query, csar plugins (using PF4J), and various utilities.
It does not specify language-specific implementation details.

The language-specific details are specified in plugins (see: `csar-plugins').
These behaviours are: parsing, post-processing, searching, and refactoring.

Plugins exhibit a few behaviours of note:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Plugins are not executed concurrently but interleaving during the same step of the process may occur.
  i.e. All plugins can be told to parse one by one, then to post-process one by one, etc.
  \item Plugins have unrestricted access to the host machine.
  \item All plugins have access to all project files, thus it is possible for two plugins to modify the same file.
  The last plugin to modify it will have its changed kept.
\end{itemize}

To create a plugin for csar the following must be done:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a new JVM project which has as dependencies: `csar-api' and `pf4j' version 2.1.0.
  \item Create a class which extends Plugin from the PF4J framework - this doesn't have to do anything special, although it can.
  Example:
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
  package org.qmul.csar;

  import org.pf4j.Plugin;
  import org.pf4j.PluginWrapper;

  /**
    * The java language plugin.
    */
  public class JavaPlugin extends Plugin {

      public JavaPlugin(PluginWrapper wrapper) {
          super(wrapper);
      }
  }
  \end{lstlisting}
  \item Create a class which implements `CsarPlugin' from `csar-api' and is annotated with `CsarJavaPlugin'.
  This should have a 0-arguments constructor.
  Implement the behaviour defined by the interface: parsing, processing, searching, and refactoring.
  This is where the language-specific work occurs.
  Example:
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
  package org.qmul.csar;

  import org.pf4j.Extension;
  import org.pf4j.Plugin;
  import org.pf4j.PluginWrapper;
  import org.qmul.csar.query.CsarQuery;
  import org.qmul.csar.result.Result;

  import java.nio.file.Path;
  import java.util.List;
      
  /**
    * The java language csar plugin.
    */
  @Extension
  public static class CsarJavaPlugin implements CsarPlugin {

      @Override
      public boolean parse(Path projectDirectory, boolean narrowSearch, Path ignoreFile, int threadCount) {
        // parsing code...
      }

      @Override
      public boolean postprocess() {
        // post-processing code...
      }

      @Override
      public List<Result> search(CsarQuery csarQuery, int threadCount) throws Exception {
        // searching code...
      }
  }
  \end{lstlisting}
  \item You must also define a few values, if you are using gradle in `gradle.properties' file, if you are not then in a `plugin.properties' file.
  This file should be as follows (note everything after `//' are comments and should be omitted):
  \begin{lstlisting}
  version=0.0.1 // defined in this format: digit '.' digit '.' digit

  pluginId=csar-java // a unique string
  pluginClass=org.qmul.csar.JavaPlugin // the fully qualified name of the plugin class
  pluginProvider=Deniz Ozmus // the author name
  pluginDependencies= // dependencies on other plugins, list them by pluginId separated with spaces
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

To use the plugin with csar the following must be done:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Compile the project into JAR format, rename it to have the `.zip' extension and place it in `/plugins/' relative to the csar front-end jar.
  \item Run the csar front-end jar, it should automatically detect and delegate tasks to your plugin.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{High-level Structure Overview}
A csar front-end is chosen and receives some input defining the task to be carried out.
The provided `csar-cli' has the following command-line arguments including a non-optional search query.
These determine what tasks csar will execute.

Its usage format is shown below:
\begin{lstlisting}
Usage: java -jar csar.jar [options] Search query
  Options:
    --threads, -t
      Thread count (default: 1)
    --log-level
      Log level (default: INFO)
      Possible Values (most restrictive to least): ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE
    --format, -f
      Output format (default: PlainText)
      Possible Values: PlainText, JSON
    --output, -o
      Output file name
    --narrow-search
      Narrow search domain (default: true)
    --ignore-file
      Ignore file (default: .csarignore)
    --project-url, --url
      Print project URL
    --help, -h
      Print help information
\end{lstlisting}

In `csar-cli' these values are stored in an instance of `CsarContext' using JCommander.
JCommander will try to match the command-line arguments with fields in said object using the values in their `@Parameter' annotations.
Then, `CsarFactory' will use this instance of `CsarContext' to create a corresponding instance of `Csar'.
At this stage, a project iterator which determines files to parse is also created.

Now, the front-end calls upon the `csar-api' to do some work.

Firstly, the csar query will be parsed using the corresponding ANTLR4 grammar.
Each csar query is comprised of four parts, but only the first is required:
\begin{itemize}
  \item `searchTarget' - The element to select.
  \item `containsQuery' - What `searchTarget' should contain within it.
  \item `fromTarget' - Where `searchTarget' should be looked for in.
  \item `refactorDescriptor' - The transformation to apply to `searchTarget'.
\end{itemize}

Secondly, the api tries to find and load plugins which will provide language-specific implementations.
Each language specific implementation will perform the following actions and return the results to the api:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Code Parsing - The project code will be parsed (currently only Java 8 is supported).
  This is after csar query is parsed because typically it takes longer, and an invalid csar query causes early.
  It will also perform some code validation because the Java 8 ANTLR4 grammar relies on post-processing for correctness.
  \item Code Post-processors - The parsed project code is post-processed to gather further details of how it all fits together. The following post-processors are applied:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item `TypeHierarchyResolver' - Resolves the type hierarchy (i.e. class hierarchy) of the code base.
    \item `MethodQualifiedTypeResolver' - Resolves types of each method's return and parameter types.
    \item `OverriddenMethodsResolver' - Marks each method which is overridden from another.
    \item `MethodUsageResolver' - Maps each method call to its method definition.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Search - The parsed project code is searched using the visitor design pattern.
  The search domain is restricted if a `FROM' clause is inserted.
  Each language element in each code file is visited, and if a match to the language descriptor we are looking for is found, then that element is added to the list of search results.
  \item Refactor - The parsed project code will be refactored, and changes will be written to source code files (unimplemented).
\end{itemize}

Finally, the results returned from the `csar-api' to the frontend will be displayed in a human-friendly manner.

Note: If an unrecoverable error occurs at any of the aforementioned stages, the error will be displayed in a user-friendly format and csar will terminate.
The user may be able to override this behaviour through sub-classing.

\subsection{Running Example}
Suppose we invoke `csar-cli' from the command-line with the following command: `java -jar csar.jar SELECT method:def:parse REFACTOR RENAME:parse2 -t 1'.
Furthermore, suppose our project has the following code files in the directory `/project/':

`Main.java':
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
public class Main extends Parser {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    new Main().run();
  }

  public void run() {
    parse();
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

`Parser.java':
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
public class Parser {

  public void parse() {
    // ...
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Firstly, these command-line arguments will be parsed and be used to instantiate a corresponding instance of `Csar'.
The directory is not home to a supported version control and does not have a `.csarignore' file so no filtering of its contents will be applied.

Secondly, the `csar-java' plugin will be found as `/plugins/plugin-csar-java-0.0.1.zip'
\begin{itemize}
  \item The project code will be parsed (on a single thread) and then post-processed.
  \item The search will be performed.
  In this case method definitions which have the name `parse' will be stored in a search results list.
  We will have the following search results:
  \begin{lstlisting}
  (path='/project/Parser.java', lineNumber=3, codeFragment='  public void parse() {')
  \end{lstlisting}

  These results will be formatted and then printed as follows:
  \begin{lstlisting}
  Search Results:
  /project/Parser.java:3 - '  public void parse() {'
  \end{lstlisting}
  \item The refactor will be performed.
  In this case all definitions and corresponding usages (these are graphed in the code post-processing) in the search results list will have their identifier names changed to `parse2'.
  These changes will then be written to the relevant source code files.
  
  We will end up with the following code files:

  `Main.java':
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
  public class Main extends Parser {
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      new Main().run();
    }
  
    public void run() {
      parse2();
    }
  }
  \end{lstlisting}
  
  `Parser.java':
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
  public class Parser {
  
    public void parse2() {
      // ...
    }
  }
  \end{lstlisting}
  
  Furthermore, we will have the following refactor results:
  \begin{lstlisting}
  (path='/project/Main.java', lineNumber=8, codeFragment='    parse2();')
  (path='/project/Parser.java', lineNumber=3, codeFragment='  public void parse2() {')
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

These results will be formatted in `csar-cli' and then printed as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
Refactor Results:
/project/Main.java:8 - '    parse2();'
/project/Parser.java:3 - '  public void parse2() {'
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, `csar-cli' will terminate.

\subsection{Query Language Analysis}
The following languages do not necessarily address my problem but they may influence the development of my own query language.

\subsubsection{AutoQuery}
Its queries are broken up into the following groups: program element types (variable, function, etc.) and identifier (if applicable), program element descriptions (contains, ofType, atLine, etc.), relation descriptions (depends on, etc.) and finally targets.
Each group can have 0 or more pieces of information within it, so it is descriptive.

Its language is unnatural (with respect to English) and is very rigid.
You can specify file, line number, types, and various elementary language elements (classes, methods, control flow).
It is not very expressive: it cannot represent try-catch blocks, anonymous methods/classes, and a long list of such constructs.

\subsubsection{AspectJ}
\href{https://eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/next/progguide/starting-aspectj.html}{AspectJ} has developed a language which it uses to address the problems presented by aspect-oriented programming.  

Their queries have a syntax that closely resembles that of Java. Examples below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item `call(void Point.setX(int)) || call(void Point.setY(int))'`'
  \item `call(void Figure.make*(..))'
  \item `call(public * Figure.* (..))
\end{itemize}

You can restrict the domain of queries with logical operators (and, or and not).
It has limited wildcards (`*', `..' which serves as `*' specially for method parameters, but it lacks `?').

You can define a query with an alias, which helps address the Don't Repeat Yourself principle, and thus verbosity.
I can also use this to provide coding standards verification (i.e. define queries and run them against the project, with matches corresponding errors in standards).
You can define method parameters as a type list or a named-type list which is flexible and expressive.

One issue is csar aims to be language-agnostic, so adopting a Java-like syntax will be unintuitive for non-Java programmers.

The syntax fails for dynamically-typed languages where types are not explicitly defined, so a method with signature: `my\_method(int)' would be invalid (or require additional processing to make work).
A solution to this is accepting variable name lists.

\subsubsection{Infer}
\href{https://github.com/facebook/infer}{Infer} has developed a language called \href{https://code.facebook.com/posts/277643589367408/}{AL} which it uses to define code templates corresponding to code stink. Example below:  

\begin{lstlisting}
DEFINE-CHECKER STRONG_DELEGATE_WARNING = {
    LET name_contains_delegate = declaration_has_name(REGEXP("[dD]elegate"));
    LET name_does_not_contain_queue = NOT declaration_has_name(REGEXP("[qQ]ueue"));

It is very descriptive (allows compositions with `AND', `NOT', `WHEN' etc.) and intuitive (similar to SQL). You can define strings as regex patterns, this is a powerful feature.
The language is verbose and thus does not resonate with csar's competitors, which use single line queries.
However, declarations and response messages can be useful for creating complex tools with csar (i.e. code convention checks).
